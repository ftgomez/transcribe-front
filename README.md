# Transcribe front
Frontend for a chatbot that uses the API of the `audio-transcribe` model. For deployment, there are two options: using `docker-compose` or Kubernetes. In both cases, both the frontend and backend are launched simultaneously, and you don't need to configure anything in the other repository.
